# dirstat
Old DOS directory statistics program

This program was one I used to keep track of how much disk space I was using. There are many better alternatives around these
days, but this was mine :) It was written in Turbo Pascal probably some time in the late 1980s. Curiously I don't seem to have
put dates on it, even though I tracked version numbers (which is how I could create a version control history)!
